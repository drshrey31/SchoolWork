### Feedback for Lab 01

Run on January 23, 17:24:32 PM.


## Feedback test:


 Feedback tests are just to make sure you followed the lab instructions relatively correctly. Correctness checking takes place in Assessment tests, where specific things are checked and points are awarded for performing the lab correctly.


 Feedback tests passing *does not* guarantee full credit for the lab.
