  let () =
    assert (take 5 facts' = [1; 1; 2; 6; 24])
    
    (* 
    
    Explanation for facts':
    
    The delay within the facts method recursively calls on factorials from the start ( factorials () ), 
    which goes back to the first value in the nats list (which is 1 as defined in factorials) 
    and thus the multiplication starts over 
    every single time from the start. 
    
    In factsâ€™ however, we dereference a ref to the current value in nats (dummy) when we 
    do the multiplication ( zip mul_p nats (! dummy) ), so therefore we start from 
    the current value in the nats list instead of from the beginning of the nats list 
    for every new multiplication. We set the value of the nats to the next value within the list 
    by changing the reference of dummy to point to factorialsâ€™. 
    So this way, we make sure to keep indexing the list by constantly changing the ref to the nats 
    and thus only compute the necessary components instead of starting over from the first element in nats 
    every single time.
